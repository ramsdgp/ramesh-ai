## 4. Process Description

The Imperial Smelting Furnace process consists of four primary stages that convert zinc ore concentrates into refined zinc metal. Each stage operates under specific temperature and #atmospheric conditions to ensure optimal metal recovery and product quality.

### 4.1 Sintering Stage

#### 4.1.1 Process Overview

Ore concentrates are roasted and agglomerated to create a porous, permeable sinter suitable for furnace charging. The sinter is preheated to 800°C before introduction to the ISF to maintain thermal efficiency and reduce coke consumption.

### 4.1.2 Operating Parameters

| Parameter                   | Target Value | Tolerance |
|----------------------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Sinter Preheat Temperature** | 800°C       | ±10°C    |
| **Roasting Temperature**       | 650–750°C   | ±20°C    |
| **Sinter Size**                | 25–75 mm    | —        |

#### 4.1.3 Critical Control Points

- **Maintain sinter preheat temperature** as close to 800°C as possible to optimize furnace heat balance.  
- **Monitor sinter porosity** to ensure adequate gas permeability in the furnace.  
- **Control sulfur content** to minimize SO₂ emissions during smelting.

### 4.2 Smelting Stage

#### 4.2.1 Process Overview

Preheated sinter and coke are charged into the furnace shaft. An air blast is introduced through tuyeres at the furnace base to combust coke and generate the high temperatures required for zinc oxide reduction. The process operates continuously with material descending through the shaft while gases rise counter-currently.

#### 4.2.2 Charging Sequence

1. Verify furnace burden level and temperature profile.  
2. Load preheated sinter (800°C) into charging hopper.  
3. Add coke in the ratio of **1 part coke to 3–4 parts sinter by weight**.  
4. Charge materials in **alternating layers** to maintain gas distribution.  
5. Monitor burden descent rate (**target: 0.5–0.8 m/h**).

#### 4.2.3 Blast Parameters

| Parameter                  | Target Value   | Tolerance |
|---------------------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Blast Temperature**     | 900–1100°C     | ±25°C     |
| **Blast Pressure**        | 1.8–2.2 bar    | ±0.1 bar  |
| **Reduction Zone Temperature** | 1200–1300°C | ±30°C     |

### 4.3 Condensation Stage

#### 4.3.1 Process Overview

Zinc vapor produced in the reduction zone rises with furnace gases and is directed to the lead splash condenser. The vapor is absorbed into molten lead maintained at 450–550°C, forming a zinc–lead alloy. This alloy is later separated to recover pure zinc metal.

#### 4.3.2 Condenser Operating Parameters

| Parameter                | Target Value | Tolerance |
|-------------------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Lead Splash Temperature** | 450–550°C | ±15°C    |
| **Zinc Capture Efficiency** | ≥95%      | —        |
| **Lead Circulation Rate**   | As required | —      |

#### 4.3.3 Monitoring Requirements

- Continuously monitor **lead splash temperature** using thermocouples.  
- Sample **zinc–lead alloy** every 2 hours for composition analysis.  
- Check for **zinc oxide buildup** in condenser ducts hourly.  
- Monitor **exit gas temperature** to verify complete condensation.

### 4.4 Slag Management

#### 4.4.1 Process Overview

Slag containing iron silicates, calcium compounds, and residual metals is tapped periodically from the furnace hearth. Proper slag management ensures high metal recovery rates and minimizes waste handling costs while maintaining furnace stability.

#### 4.4.2 Target Parameters

| Parameter                 | Target Value      |
|--------------------------|-------------------|
| **Slag-to-Feed Ratio**   | ~12%              |
| **Slag Tapping Temperature** | 1100–1200°C  |
| **Residual Zinc in Slag** | \<2% Zn          |
| **Tapping Frequency**     | Every 4–6 hours  |

#### 4.4.3 Slag Handling Procedure

1. Monitor slag level in furnace hearth using level indicators.  
2. Verify slag tap hole is clear and heating is adequate.  
3. Open slag tap using mechanical or oxygen lance methods.  
4. Direct molten slag into granulation pit or slag pots.  
5. Sample slag for zinc content analysis before disposal.  
6. Close and seal tap hole with clay or refractory material.
